These are not in order. Research experience is the most important, because you need to know what you’re getting into. I don’t even know what I’m getting into yet, since I haven’t done a PhD, but I have much better idea than most of the people out there thinking about it. I know what it’s like because I’ve worked on research during the school year, and then I worked on it full-time during the summer. I’ve worked on things that are similar to what PhD students and lab technicians work on. This gives me a sense of what goes on in a day-to-day basis sense. I still have no idea what I’m dealing with in terms of things not working for months and months on end, but I’m confident that I’ll be able to survive it because I’ve persevered other obstacles in life before. I fully expect doing a PhD is going to be kind of terrible in many ways, and I think that the sooner people are aware of that the better they can start thinking seriously about whether they want to do it. You’re paid a stipend similar to minimum wage. You’re working constantly. You’re working on one thing so it’s very difficult when it isn’t working. You’re often working by yourself. You’re working on hard things. You’re working directly under a boss who you’re going to disagree with in many cases. You’re working with a limited group of people in your lab and you might not get along with some of them, and you have to get along with them for years. It’s going to be kind of terrible. (I’d advise people to read PhD Comics for common complaints in grad school. I thought it was really depressing the first time I came upon it, but once you’ve resolved yourself to it it’s just constant inside-jokes :)).
