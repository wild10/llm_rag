On the other hand, once you’ve realized all of these unhappy things will happen, you can start figuring out if the upsides are worth it. You’re working on something you really like. Your job is pretty much what you want to think about for fun. You’re learning, constantly. You can do whatever you want. You have almost complete freedom with your time. You have free coursework. You get to (have to) teach. You get to interact with leaders in your field and in the world. You get to go to conferences. You get to hang out with really smart people all day. You get to change the world in the tiniest of ways. You are constantly expanding your horizons. You’re going to end up with a nice shiny degree at the end. Did I mention you get to learn all the time about what you want to learn about?.

Those are some of my reasons for wanting to go to grad school: I don’t think it matters what they are, as long as you’ve thought seriously about both the pros and cons. It takes a long time—I’ve wanted to be a professor since high school, but I did some serious waffling every time I learned a new element of what grad school actually entails. (Hint: I didn’t even know professors did research when I started out.) Then I had to do a lot of research and figure out if I liked it or not, and evaluate all of the other paths I could go down, and do lots of internal pro and con lists of what I wanted out of a job, and in the end I ended up completely sure I wanted to go to graduate school. So that’s, I think, the main reason why we need experience in research. To figure out if it’s the kind of work we like to do and would want to do for 5-7 years in the US (3-4 years in the UK).
